# Welcome to HSLearnToHack!
We hope you're excited!  
Cause if you're not...  
you will be!

## Introduction
(Insert information about who we are, why we're doing this, and other stuff)

---

## Let's look at the big picture of this project
* What will you be making?
  * Snake (best game ever!)
* What will you learn?
  * Basics of HTML to create webpages  
  * JavaScript to create the actual game

# Let's talk about HTML
The backbone of websites!

---

## What is HTML?
* HyperText Markup Language
* Markup language - a way of annotating a document so that it is distinguishable from text  
 (eg. marking up paper documents)
* Most recent version is HTML5  
 Main goal was to add support for multimedia (more efficient YouTube videos!)

---

## Fundamental HTML syntax for structuring a page
* What is syntax? - a set of rules for the ordering of words to make them meaningful

>`<!DOCTYPE html>` -  Tells your browser what type of file to expect  

>`<html>` - Marks the start of the HTML  

>`<head>` - Starts the header of the document  

>`<title>YOUR TITLE</title>` - Sets the title (displayed in browser)  

>`<body>` - Marks the beginning of the body of the document

---
## Try this example in a text editor!
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
      <title>Your Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body> - Starts the body
      <h1>Heading 1</h1> - Sets a heading of type 1 (largest)
      <p>This is a paragraph</p> - Sets paragraph text
  </body> - Ends the body
</html> - Marks the end of the HTML
```

---
## Test it out!
* Save the file to an easy-to-access location with the extension `html`  
  (eg. `MyPage.html`)
* Open it in your favorite browser, either by double-clicking on the file or using `File -> Open` from inside the browser
* See the result of your work!

---
## Making a form
* Why do we need a form for a Snake game?
* Let's go through the code, line by line

>`<form id="selection">`  
Marks the start of the form, with the ID attribute "selection"

>`<input type="radio" id="easy" name="selection">Easy`  
Creates a radio button, with the given ID/name that is labeled "Easy"

>`<input type="radio" id="intermediate" name="selection" checked>Intermediate`  
Another radio button for "Intermediate", checked by default

>`<input type="radio" id="difficult" name="selection">Difficult`  
One last button for a "Difficult" setting

>`</form>`  
Marks the end of the form

---

## The form code
```
<form id="selection">
    <input type="radio" id="easy" name="selection">Easy
    <input type="radio" id="intermediate" name="selection" checked>
    Intermediate
    <input type="radio" id="difficult" name="selection">Difficult
</form>
```

---

## The `<canvas>` tag
* To draw the snake game in the page, we will need to use a `<canvas>` tag
* The `<canvas>` tag is a container, or placeholder, for graphics that are drawn using your JavaScript code

* An example is as follows:
```
<canvas id="gameboard" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
```

---

## JavaScript in HTML
* We can fit JavaScript code in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag
* The `<script>` tag is used to denote client-side (runs in your browser) JavaScript
* We can type the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags, as below:
```
<script>
YOUR JAVASCRIPT HERE
</script>
```

* However, let's make a new file that will hold our Snake code, called `snake.js`
* Now, link it into your existing HTML file to keep things neat and tidy, as below:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="snake.js">
</script>
```

# Learning JavaScript
This is where things get fun!

---

## What is JavaScript?
* The most popular programming language on the web!
* Used to change what displays on a website by modifying content
* Can also add functionality such as validating data (eg. email), etc.
* Essentially, it serves to add behaviors to a website

---

## Comparison operators
* Comparison and logical operators return (are evaluated to) values of either true or false (Boolean)
* For example, the equality operator `==` returns `true` if you type `5 == 4+1`
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`(true == false)`

---

## Comparison operators
* Comparison and logical operators return (are evaluated to) values of either true or false (Boolean)
* For example, the equality operator `==` returns `true` if you type `5 == 4+1`
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`(true == false)`  
>It is .red[false]!
* Try more examples with this operator at the JavaScript tutorial site!

---

## Comparison operators (cont.)
* Not equal to `!=`
* Greater than `>`
* Greater than or equal to `>=`
* Less than `<`
* Less than or equal to `<=`

---

## Logical operators
* Can be used to combine other conditional statements (such as those we just learned)
* For example, what if you want to do something only if two different equality operators both evaluate to true?
* Use the `and` operator `&&`  
>Returns `true` if both sides are true
* Statements can be enclosed in parentheses to maintain order of operations
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?  
>`((5 == 4 + 1) && (8 == 8))`

* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`((8 == 8) && (5 == 6 - 2))`

---
## Logical operators (cont.)
* *Think about it:* Is this statement true or false?
>`((8 == 8) && (5 == 6 - 2))`  
>It is .red[true]!
* Or operator `||`  
>Evalutes to true if one or both of the statements are true
* Not operator `!`  
>Takes one statement as input, evalutes to true if the statement is not true, or false

---

## Conditional statements
* How do we use Boolean statements to change what happens in our code?
* *Think about it:* Why is this important?

---

## Conditional statements
* How do we use Boolean statements to change what happens in our code?
* *Think about it:* Why is this important?
* We can control what parts of our code run based on true/false values using `if/else` statements
* Keep in mind:* The `alert()` function displays a popup box with the provided message
* Let's go over the following code  
```
if (hour < 12) {
      alert("Good morning!");
}
else if (hour < 18) {
      alert("Good afaternon!");
}
else {
      alert("Good night!");
}
```

---

## Variables
* A variable is a way to refer to a value, similar to variables in math
* Here is an example of creating a variable, named `x`:
>`var x;`
* Let's set the value of `x` to 5:
>`x = 5`
* We can alternatively make a variable and set it to a value in one step:
>`var y = 7`
* Now when you access the variable `y`, you will be accessing the value `7`
>`alert(y);`
* This code results in a popup box (using the `alert()` function) with 7 as the message

---

## Variables (cont.)
* You can also create a variable using the value of another variable
* *Think about it:* What is the variable `y` equal to after these two lines are executed?
>`var x = 5;`  
>`var y = x + x;`

---

## Variables (cont.)
* You can also create a variable using the value of another variable
* *Think about it:* What is the variable `y` equal to after these two lines are executed?
>`var x = 5;`  
>`var y = x + x;`  
>`y` is now equal to .red[10]!

---

## Arrays
* An array allows for the grouping of multiple variables with indexes
* Each element in an array can be accessed by a unique index
* Let's create an array with four integers
>`var numbers = [3, 1, 2];`

---

## Review
* What is the output of this code?
```
var a;
if (5 == 3 + 2)
      a = 3;
else
      a = 6;
var y = a * 3;
if ((y > x) && (a < 4))
      y = 10;
alert(y);
```
